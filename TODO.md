Tommy:
-  [x] Produce a tabular dataset of precip / temp / vegetation health indices
- [x] upload to github (if < 50mb) (SENT BY WE TRANSFER)
- [x] Mask out the sea values (not sure if already done - check!)
- [ ] Transfer the code from the EGU poster into a useable format for use with xarray data

Gabriel:
- [x] produce project skeleton
- [x] Mask out the LST values == 200

Experiments:
- How sensitive are the different models to the input datasets? Sensitivity analysis (train on different years)
- Are we better at predicting high/low ndvi values?
- how many months ahead can we accurately forecast?
